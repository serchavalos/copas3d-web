# Cup Shaper 3D Modeler

Inspired by one of my first programming projects in college where the original was written in C++ by our teacher in 2004.

While the main goal back then was to familiarize us with simple data structures, I was captivated by the graphics and the 3D impressions that could be achieved with basic arithmetics[^1]. And after a failed attempt compiling the original code in a modern environment, I decided to port it into a web app as it would also make it easier to display. (To honor the author's work, I kept most of the code unchanged).

Transforming this simple program is purely a nostalgic gesture from the good old school days. There is no intention of using it for profit or even educational purposes.

[^1]: As far as my memory recalls, the version I remember included slightly more advance Math functions than Sine and Cosine, but I was shy to ask for any recent alterations after 20 years.
